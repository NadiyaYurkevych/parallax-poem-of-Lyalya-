		<h1>Lyalya.</h1>
			<p>I was sitting in the pipe.🛣️
			   It was cold and scary. 🌧️⛈️
			   But someone's kind hands, 🤲
			   They found me so in time.💞
			   They took me to their home, warmed me, and fed me.🏡
			   🔥🥫🍱
			   In addition, they gave me candies, and named Lyalya. 🍬🐱
			   I feel very well in my new home. 🏡
			   I play all day with Tutsik(rabbit) in the backyard. 🐰🌞
			   And when the night comes, and I want to sleep, 🌃
			   I run very quickly to Nadiya's room. 🛋️🙋
			   There, I will curl up under her side, 🐱👩‍💻
			   And I will take a sweet nap in the deep black night...🌌
